// function statement :
//                     writing a function is called function statement.

// function expression :
//                     assign a function (anonymous function) to a variable is called function expression.

// Difference between both is :
//                             hoisting =>call before function body.
//                             statement will not throw any eror , however expression comes up with an error (type error)

// function statement and function declaration both are same.

//anonymous function uses in call back functions

// params passes in function creating time while arguments passes during calling time
